# Tree3 tag
A simple tree tag

## Initial ideas

_If you can express it in HTML then you can express it in JS_

By default, any HTML code defacto is a tree. The main key is the CSS set of rules we want to apply in order to represent a tree following the Material Design's principles.

Let's try a demo that shows how to construct a tree based on MD's list.

## Tree's actions

Expand/Contract.

CRUD. Moreover, every leaf has a three-dots icon that holds some custom actions, i.e

1. Add subleaf

2. View detailed

3. Edit

4. Remove

Also, it's desirable to redact the leaf's text, via click or via Edit.
